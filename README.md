# Trading-with-Momentum
In this project, I have implement a trading strategy and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. Used universe of stocks and time range. generated a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. computed the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, will be using the end of day from Quotemedia.
